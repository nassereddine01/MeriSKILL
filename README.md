# MeriSKILL Data Science Portfolio

## Overview

Welcome to my Data Science portfolio! This repository highlights two significant tasks completed during my internship at MeriSKILL: "HR Analytics, and the "Diabetes Patient" task.

## HR Analytics Task for MeriSKILL

### Description
The "HR Analytics" task involved leveraging data-driven insights to enhance HR strategies at MeriSKILL. The project focused on analyzing workforce patterns, uncovering trends, and providing actionable recommendations.

## Diabetes Patient Task

### Description
The "Diabetes Patient" task aimed to develop a predictive model for identifying potential diabetes patients based on relevant health indicators. The scope encompassed data exploration, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The primary objectives were to:

- Analyze and preprocess a dataset containing health-related features.
- Identify key indicators and patterns associated with diabetes risk.
- Implement a machine learning model for predicting the likelihood of diabetes.
- Evaluate the model's performance and provide insights for potential intervention strategies.
